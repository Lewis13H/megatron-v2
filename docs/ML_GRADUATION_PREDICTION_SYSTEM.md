# ML-Based Graduation Prediction System

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the implementation of a Machine Learning system to predict token graduation from Pump.fun to Raydium with 85-90% accuracy. The system enhances the current rule-based technical scoring (333 points) with ML models trained on 150+ features.

## Current System Analysis

### Technical Scoring Limitations
- **Rule-based scoring**: Fixed weights, no learning from outcomes
- **Limited features**: Only 4 categories (market cap, bonding curve, trading health, sell-off)
- **No pattern recognition**: Misses complex temporal and cross-token patterns
- **Static thresholds**: Doesn't adapt to market conditions

### ML Opportunity
- **Graduation rate**: ~2% of 100k+ tokens weekly
- **Clear target**: Binary classification (graduated vs not graduated)
- **Rich data**: Transaction history, holder patterns, price movements
- **Time advantage**: 4-8 hour prediction window enables profitable entry

## Feature Engineering Strategy

### 1. Enhanced Technical Features (50+ features)
```python
# Beyond current scoring
- Price momentum indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands)
- Volume-weighted average price (VWAP)
- Order flow imbalance
- Microstructure features (bid-ask spread, depth)
- Volatility regime changes
- Support/resistance levels
```

### 2. Temporal Pattern Features (40+ features)
```python
# Time-series patterns
- Holder growth velocity (1h, 4h, 24h)
- Volume acceleration (second derivative)
- Bonding curve acceleration
- Cyclical patterns (hour of day, day of week)
- Time since launch normalization
- Trend breakout detection
```

### 3. Holder Behavior Features (30+ features)
```python
# Wallet analysis
- Gini coefficient (wealth distribution)
- Herfindahl index (concentration)
- Holder churn rate
- Average hold duration
- Smart money accumulation
- Whale entry timing
- Network density between holders
```

### 4. Cross-Token Correlation (20+ features)
```python
# Market context
- Category graduation rates
- Creator success history
- Concurrent launches competition
- Market sentiment alignment
- SOL price correlation
- Similar token performance
```

### 5. Social Signal Features (10+ features)
```python
# External signals (via TweetScout API)
- Twitter mention velocity
- Sentiment analysis
- Influencer engagement
- Community growth rate
- Cross-platform presence
```

## ML Architecture

### Model Ensemble
```python
class GraduationPredictor:
    models = {
        'xgboost': XGBClassifier(n_estimators=500, max_depth=7),
        'lightgbm': LGBMClassifier(n_estimators=500, learning_rate=0.01),
        'neural_net': MLPClassifier(hidden_layers=(256,128,64))
    }
    
    # Weighted voting ensemble
    weights = [0.4, 0.4, 0.2]  # Favor gradient boosting
```

### Training Pipeline
1. **Data Collection**: 30-day historical data with labels
2. **Feature Extraction**: Parallel processing of 150+ features
3. **Time-Series Split**: Respect temporal ordering
4. **Model Training**: Ensemble with early stopping
5. **Validation**: ROC-AUC > 0.85 target
6. **Deployment**: Versioned model with A/B testing

### Inference Pipeline
```python
# Real-time prediction flow
1. Stream transaction â†’ 
2. Extract features (cached) â†’ 
3. Scale features â†’ 
4. Ensemble prediction â†’ 
5. Cache result (60s) â†’ 
6. Alert if P(graduation) > 0.7
```

## Database Schema Extensions

### New Tables
```sql
-- Feature store
CREATE TABLE ml_features (
    token_id UUID,
    extracted_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
    features JSONB,  -- 150+ features
    feature_version INT
);

-- Predictions
CREATE TABLE ml_predictions (
    token_id UUID,
    predicted_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
    graduation_probability DECIMAL(5,4),
    model_version VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Training labels
CREATE TABLE ml_labels (
    token_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    graduated BOOLEAN,
    graduation_time INTERVAL,
    sol_collected DECIMAL
);

-- Holder analytics
CREATE TABLE holder_analytics (
    token_id UUID,
    analyzed_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
    gini_coefficient DECIMAL(5,4),
    top_10_percentage DECIMAL(5,2),
    holder_churn_rate DECIMAL(5,4)
);
```

// Weight ML higher as confidence increases
combinedScore = technicalScore * 0.3 + mlProbability * 333 * 0.7
```

### Monitor Integration
```typescript
// Add to transaction monitor
async function processTransaction(tx: Transaction) {
  // Existing processing
  await monitorService.saveTransaction(tx);
  
  // ML prediction trigger
  if (tx.type === 'buy' && tx.sol_amount > 0.1) {
    const prediction = await mlClient.getPrediction(tx.token_id);
    
    if (prediction.probability > 0.7) {
      console.log(`ðŸŽ¯ HIGH GRADUATION PROBABILITY: ${prediction.probability}`);
      await alertService.send('graduation_likely', tx);
    }
