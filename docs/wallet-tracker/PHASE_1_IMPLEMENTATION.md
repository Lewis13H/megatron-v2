# Wallet Tracker System - Phase 1 Implementation Complete

## Overview
Phase 1 of the Wallet Tracker System has been successfully implemented. This phase focuses on **Historical Data Collection with Validation**, providing the foundation for tracking and scoring wallet performance with graduated tokens.

## Implemented Components

### 1. Database Schema (`024_create_wallet_tracker_tables.sql`)
- **wallet_traders**: Main wallet profile table with classification and scoring
- **wallet_relationships**: Tracks wallet relationships for Sybil detection
- **wallet_clusters**: Groups of potentially coordinated wallets
- **wallet_trades**: Historical trade records with graduation timing
- **wallet_positions**: Token positions with PnL tracking
- **wallet_scores_history**: Time-series scoring history
- **token_smart_money_signals**: Smart money signals for tokens

All tables include:
- Proper indexes for performance
- Check constraints for data integrity
- TimescaleDB hypertable support where applicable
- Update triggers for timestamp management

### 2. Core Services

#### WalletTrackerService (`wallet-tracker-service.ts`)
Main service for wallet data management:
- Create/update wallet profiles
- Save and retrieve trades
- Manage positions and PnL
- Calculate and store scores
- Generate smart money signals

#### GraduatedTokenFetcher (`graduated-token-fetcher.ts`)
Fetches and validates graduated tokens:
- Query from local database (primary source)
- Fallback to Helius API if needed
- Validation of graduation data
- Peak price calculation
- Statistics generation

#### TransactionFetcher (`transaction-fetcher.ts`)
Retrieves and processes transaction data:
- Database-first approach with external fallback
- Pre-graduation transaction filtering
- Batch processing capabilities
- Early buyer identification
- Transaction validation

#### WalletProfileExtractor (`wallet-profile-extractor.ts`)
Analyzes wallet behavior and builds profiles:
- Metrics calculation (PnL, win rate, hold time)
- Wallet classification (bot, whale, dev, influencer)
- Reputation scoring
- Suspicious activity detection
- Batch profile extraction

#### DataValidator (`data-validator.ts`)
Comprehensive data validation:
- Graduated token validation
- Transaction data validation
- Wallet profile validation
- Trade data validation
- Batch validation with reporting
- Data consistency checks

### 3. CLI Tool (`collect-historical-data.ts`)
Main entry point for Phase 1 data collection:
- Step-by-step execution with progress tracking
- Batch processing with rate limiting
- Comprehensive validation at each step
- Detailed reporting and statistics
- Error handling and recovery

## How to Use

### 1. Run Database Migration
```bash
npm run wallet-tracker:migrate
```
This creates all necessary tables and functions.

### 2. Collect Historical Data
```bash
npm run wallet-tracker:collect
```
This runs the complete Phase 1 data collection process:
1. Fetches graduated tokens
2. Retrieves pre-graduation transactions
3. Extracts unique wallet addresses
4. Builds wallet profiles with classification
5. Saves validated trades to database
6. Updates wallet metrics
7. Generates collection report

### 3. Query Data
After collection, you can query the data using the service:

```typescript
import { walletTrackerService } from './src/services/wallet-tracker';

// Get top wallets
const topWallets = await walletTrackerService.getTopWallets(100);

// Get smart money wallets
const smartWallets = await walletTrackerService.getSmartMoneyWallets(700);

// Get wallet details
const wallet = await walletTrackerService.getWallet('wallet_address_here');

// Get token smart money signals
const signals = await walletTrackerService.getTokenSmartMoneySignals('token_mint_here');
```

## Key Features Implemented

### Data Validation
- Solana address validation
- Timestamp consistency checks
- Amount and price validation
- Transaction type verification
- Relationship consistency validation

### Wallet Classification
- **Bot Detection**: Fast transaction patterns, round numbers
- **Whale Detection**: High volume trading (>1000 SOL)
- **Dev Detection**: Consistent early token purchases
- **Influencer Detection**: High win rate with multiple graduations

### Anti-Gaming Measures
- Suspicious activity counting
- Wash trading detection
- Cluster relationship tracking (prepared for Phase 3)
- Reputation scoring system

### Performance Optimizations
- Batch processing with configurable size
- Database-first approach with fallbacks
- Connection pooling
- Rate limiting for external APIs
- Progress tracking and reporting

## Data Flow

1. **Graduated Tokens** → Fetch from DB → Validate → Get peak prices
2. **Transactions** → Fetch pre-graduation txs → Validate → Extract buyers
3. **Wallets** → Build profiles → Classify → Calculate metrics
4. **Trades** → Convert from txs → Add graduation timing → Batch save
5. **Metrics** → Calculate PnL → Update win rates → Store history

## Next Steps (Phase 2: PnL Calculation)

Phase 2 will focus on advanced PnL calculation with edge case handling:
- FIFO matching implementation
- Rug pull detection and handling
- Partial sell tracking
- DCA strategy recognition
- Position state management
- PnL validation and reconciliation

## Configuration

Ensure these environment variables are set:
```env
# Database
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=megatron_v2
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=your_password

# Optional: External APIs
HELIUS_API_KEY=your_key  # For fallback data fetching
RPC_ENDPOINT=https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
```

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Check Collection Status
```sql
-- Total wallets collected
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM wallet_traders;

-- Top performing wallets
SELECT wallet_address, trader_score, total_pnl_sol, win_rate
FROM wallet_traders
ORDER BY trader_score DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Graduated tokens processed
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT token_mint) FROM wallet_trades
WHERE is_graduated_token = true;
```

### Data Quality Checks
```sql
-- Check for data inconsistencies
SELECT wallet_address, 
       total_trades,
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM wallet_trades WHERE wallet_address = wt.wallet_address) as actual_trades
FROM wallet_traders wt
WHERE total_trades != (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM wallet_trades WHERE wallet_address = wt.wallet_address);
```

## Performance Metrics

Expected performance for Phase 1:
- **Token Processing**: ~100 graduated tokens/minute
- **Transaction Fetching**: ~1000 transactions/second from DB
- **Wallet Profile Building**: ~50 wallets/second
- **Trade Saving**: ~500 trades/second in batches
- **Total Time**: ~5-10 minutes for 100 graduated tokens

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database Connection Failed**
   - Check PostgreSQL is running
   - Verify connection settings in .env
   - Ensure database exists

2. **No Graduated Tokens Found**
   - Check graduated_tokens table has data
   - Verify graduation monitor has been running
   - Check date ranges in queries

3. **Slow Performance**
   - Increase batch sizes in code
   - Check database indexes are created
   - Consider using TimescaleDB for time-series data

4. **Validation Errors**
   - Review validation report in console
   - Check data sources for corruption
   - Manually inspect problematic records

## Success Criteria Met

✅ Graduated token fetching with multi-source support  
✅ Transaction fetching with validation  
✅ Wallet profile extraction with classification  
✅ Basic Sybil detection preparation  
✅ Data validation procedures  
✅ Batch processing capabilities  
✅ Progress tracking and reporting  
✅ Error handling and recovery
